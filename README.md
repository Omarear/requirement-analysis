# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis in Software Development** repository. This repository serves as a comprehensive foundation for understanding and executing the requirement analysis phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 

Through this project, we aim to:
- Master the principles of requirement gathering and analysis.
- Develop structured and precise documentation for a booking management system.
- Utilize tools like Draw.io for visual representations.
- Define functional and non-functional requirements along with acceptance criteria.

Stay tuned for detailed tasks and deliverables as we build a robust blueprint for a scalable software system!
